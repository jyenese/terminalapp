# TRAVEL LOG

#### **Description (Brief overview)**
-  An easy reading application that you can add, view, edit or delete future or previous travel locations. 

-  A travel log for all of your previous travels where you can view the time you went, how many days you were there, additional comments about the trip, and how much you rated it.

- A leaderboard ranking system, which ranks the highest to lowest scored rating per travel on a seperate directory.

- Wishlist directory with a viewing board and add function.

#### **Functionality**

As starting the application you are prompted with a menu asking you for input from 1-8 (numeric) on which function you'd like to explore.

- To exit back to the menu, the option to click 'Enter' is available after every functional abilty.

### **Leaderboard**

Once selecting "2" the 'Leaderboard' will show your travel dictionary but from highest to lowest rating. (10 being at the top, 1 being at the bottom)

- As you can see its now viewing the same directory as the travel directory, but rating changes the way it lists.
